# BONUS PROJECT TiTle: Effect of carrier frequency offset (CFO) on OFDM signal

One of the main critical points against OFDM transmission is the fact that it is very susceptible to impairments that can quite degrade its performance. One such impairment is Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO), where the carrier used by the receiver has a frequency that is shifted by Δ𝑓 from the frequency of the transmitter carrier. In this topic, you need to explain the effect of the CFO mismatch on the decoding of the OFDM signal and how this Δ𝑓 can be 1) estimated by the receiver, and 2) compensated for.
